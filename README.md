# enphase2influx conversion service and database pusher

## Objective
Dumps locally available Envoy-S metering data from http://local_enphase/production.json and put those data in InfluxDB for graphing using Grafana. Scripts provided to read the data every 15 seconds, works well on a PI. Does not rely on Enphase distant API (hence no cloud API or cloud server).

## Dependencies
- python 2
- `influxdb` installed with a database called `enphase` already created
- An Enphase Envoy-S meter with a known IP address

## Installation
- Tests can be done locally using the `pullAndSend.py` script
- Automatic mode can be done using the script `enphase2Influx_15sec.sh` which will dump the data every 15 seconds to the DB (which is quite a lot and could be tuned to your needs)
- The `enphase.service`, which is `systemd` unit file, can be used for startup at login in Linux
